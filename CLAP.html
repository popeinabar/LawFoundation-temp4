                CLAP : Children Legal Aid & Protection</h1>
                <p class="about-CLAP">[Organization Name] Legal Aid & Protection (CLAP) is an essential initiative undertaken by our
                    organization, which is committed to serving the needs of children in conflict with the law and those
                    requiring care and protection. The primary focus of the program is to facilitate access to socio-legal
                    aid, fundamental right to education, reintegration, and rehabilitation of such children in society.
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-CLAP">Children in conflict with the law are those who have been alleged to commit an act
                    that is prohibited by
                    law. These children are often vulnerable and face a multitude of challenges, including inadequate legal
                    representation, stigma, and social exclusion. The CLAP program is designed to provide these children
                    with access to socio-legal aid, which includes legal representation, counseling, and support services.
                    This initiative is crucial in ensuring that these children receive fair and just treatment in the legal
                    system and are not denied their fundamental rights.
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-CLAP">The program also recognizes the importance of education in the lives of these
                    children. Therefore, it aims to provide them with access to education and help them overcome barriers to
                    education. The right to education is a fundamental right of every child, and the CLAP program ensures
                    that this right is not denied to children in conflict with the law.
                    Another important aspect of the CLAP program is reintegration and rehabilitation. Children in conflict
                    with the law often face significant challenges in reintegrating into society. This initiative aims to
                    provide them with the necessary support to reintegrate and lead a normal life. The program also provides
                    rehabilitation services to children who have been victims of abuse or exploitation.
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-CLAP">The CLAP program is an essential initiative undertaken by our

            <h2>(CICL remand as adult in prison)</h2>
            <p>An exploratory study conducted in collaboration with [International Organization] & [Educational Institution] aimed to shed light on the
                issue of Children in Conflict with Law (CICL) who were remanded in prisons as adults in Bihar,
                India. The study revealed that several children who were below 18 years of age were sent to jail by
                portraying them as adults, which is a gross violation of their rights.
                The practice of sending children to jails with adult inmates exposes them to a range of risks and
                dangers, including physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation. This situation is further
                exacerbated by the lack of basic amenities and services in the prisons.
            </p>
            
            <p>The study also underscores the importance of raising awareness among stakeholders, including law
                enforcement agencies, the judiciary, civil society organizations, and the general public, about the
                rights of CICL and the harmful consequences of sending them to jails with adult inmates.
            </p>
            
            <p>In conclusion, the study conducted in collaboration with [International Organization] & [Educational Institution] has brought to light a
                concerning issue of children in conflict with the law being remanded in prisons as adults in Bihar.
                It is essential that immediate action is taken to protect the rights of these children and ensure
                that they are treated in accordance with the law. This requires a concerted effort from all
                stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and the general public.

            <h4>Justice is delayed but not denied</h4>
            <h5>(A Minor Child)</h5>
            <p>
                <span>Primary Information:</span> The director of the organization Mr. [Director Name] met him in [date]
                during his first
                prison visit. He was wearing a dark blue colored half pant and sky-blue half shirt, which is a school
                uniform usually in [location]. He was loitering in the ground of the prison when his sight was caught holded
                by [Director Name].
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [Person Name], a person who was in the [age] of his life where dreams of having a good life,
                earning a good money, enjoying the adulthood start to peep through the eyes. [He/She] belonged to an extremely
                backward class. [He/She] had [number] brothers and [number] sisters, [his/her] mother used to sell vegetables at [location] City
                Railway Station and [he/she] used to assist [his/her] mother every day.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span>Case Background:</span> Somehow they were trying to cope-up with all their needs, but life
                shattered for them
                on [date] when their youngest [son/daughter] [Person Name] was sent to prison upon allegations of dacoity and
                consumption of drugs. When [he/she] was arrested in one case [he/she] was made accused in another case of dacoity
                too that occurred in the same area in the month of March where F.I.R was lodged against an unknown
                person. [He/She] had no direct relation in both the cases. The overall punishment in all these cases summed up
                to imprisonment of life. Surprisingly, all the accused in this case belonged to one caste i.e., [Caste]
                belonging to [Category] category.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span>Legal Recourse:</span> [Person Name] grabbed attention of Mr. [Director Name]. In all the people [his/her] age was the
                factor that
                struck the eyes. [He/She] from nowhere appeared to be an adult who should be kept here in a place made for
                adult prisoners. After having a conversation with the little [boy/girl], a home visit was conducted to [his/her]
                place where [his/her] family and [his/her] elder brother told that [he/she] was not 20 years as stated by the police
                instead [he/she] is just 13 and half years old on the alleged day of occurrence. Mr. [Director Name] then inquired
                about documents such as birth certificate or school certificate to which the family looked clueless and
                also helpless. Somehow [he/she] gathered information of the last class [he/she] attended if any in any school, to
                which a positive response was received. Mr. [Director Name] reached to [his/her] school namely [School Name]
                from where [he/she] explained the principal everything about the situation and asked him to issue
                a certificate which could verify [his/her] age. The school issued the transfer certificate and [his/her] age was
                verified in the court of law after which [he/she] was declared juvenile in the month of September and [his/her] case
                was transferred to Juvenile Justice Board, [JJ Board Location]. In the JJ Board, an application was made for
                granting [his/her] bail. The Principal of the school was bought before the court and he testified that [Person Name]
                was a juvenile upon which [he/she] was granted bail.

            <p>
                <span>Back to normal life:</span> [Person Name] was the student of class VIII when [he/she] gets into custody because
                [he/she] was in the jail [his/her] name was struck off from school which resulted in discontinuation of [his/her]
                studies. We helped in getting [his/her] admission and now [he/she] is studying and living [his/her] normal and happy life
                with [his/her] parents and siblings.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span>Gap Analysis and Conclusion:</span> This case not only highlights the issues our criminal justice
                system is filled with but also challenges people holding a very important place in the justice system.
                The case from tip to toe is filled with gaps:
                <ul id="[Person Name]-lists">
                    <li>The first appearance of the [boy/girl] was enough to describe the age of the [boy/girl], yet the police ignored
                        [his/her] age factor and mentioned [his/her] age as 20 years, ending the very purpose of JJ Act.
                    </li>
                    <li>The police were not capable enough to determine the age of the [boy/girl] but what happened to the
                        Magistrate, had he too turned blind that he was not able to see that the [boy/girl] is below 18 and not 20.
                    </li>
                    <li>The sections imposed upon [him/her] were grave and very serious, if the school certificate was not
                        produced [he/she] might have had to rot in jail for life.
                    </li>
                    <li>In the case where an F.I.R was lodged against an unknown person, the informant described the person
                        as one in age group, having a strong body, in such case how can the police relate the [age of Person Name].
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

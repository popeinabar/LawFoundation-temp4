            <div class="stories" id="[Unique Identifier]">
                <h4>Negligence is a threat to Justice</h4>
            
                <p>
                    <span>Case Background:</span> On [Date] a young man aged 22 years was apprehended by the Railway
                    Police on
                    accusations of theft and was put behind the bars. He was booked under Section 379/411 of the Indian
                    Penal Code 1860 i.e., Theft, which prescribes punishment of up to three years or a fine or both. His
                    bail application was rejected by the lower court after which he knocked on the doors of Sessions Judge,
                    [Location] where he was granted bail on [Date]. But due to his inability to furnish bail bond, he was not
                    released on bail and languished in jail thereafter.
                </p>
                <p>In January 2022 while a usual visit to Jahanabad Sub-Jail for identifying prisoners in need of legal aid
                    we came across this alleged prisoner who was still imprisoned. He has served the total punishment
                    prescribed for theft being an under-trial prisoner whose trial was not concluded yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Legal Recourse:</span> Panel Advocates of [Organization Name] Foundation filed an evidence close petition in the
                    Railway Judicial Magistrate, [Location] for him after knowing his tyrannical journey with the justice
                    system. This application was rejected without considering the struggle and conditions faced by him all
                    these years. While giving him legal assistance, we did not give up hope. The pathway to justice is
                    always difficult, it’s just the hope that keeps up boosted to fight the injustice prevailing in the
                    system. In February 2022 a new magistrate was appointed in the Railway Court. Without wasting any time,
                    we approached the newly joined magistrate for getting relief. He very well understood our concerns and
                    agreed to entertain this petition in light of justice. Thereafter, he closed all evidence in this case
                    and acquitted him, on the lack of evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Gaps Analysis and Conclusion:</span> This particular case shows us the several loopholes and gaps
                    that our criminal justice system is filled up with. Despite getting bail the person is languishing in
                    jail and the judicial officer has no checks and balances in this regard. The chargesheet was filed, the
                    cognizance was taken and the charge was also framed in-spite of all this the case is never put on trial.
                    A person can only be punished for the prescribed term of punishment. Once he serves the prescribed time,
                    he cannot be apprehended but, in this case, the accused is serving in prison more than the prescribed
                    tenure while he is an undertrial.
                    Justice was never served to him. He is a big example of the negligence bar and the bench towards
                    prisoners languishing in jail. He was acquitted after 3 years and 6 months, which is not justice but his
                    right to be freed.

                <span>Case Background:</span> [Victim Name], a boy who left his hometown [Hometown], to hunt for jobs in a big
                city, never
                knew would land up in jail because of the powerful people who misuse their position. Can someone’s face
                describe his intentions ever, if yes then the jails would have more people there. But, here in this case
                the police merely on the basis of their suspicion that the boy would commit a cognizable offence under
                Sections of I.P.C. arrested him and sent him to judicial custody. While our visit to [Jail Name] for
                the identification of inmates who require legal aid, this boy came up to us and was crying profusely. He
                stated that he used to earn in [City Name] but due to the lockdown he was forced to return back to his
                hometown. Once this COVID situation cooled down he decided to return back to work, and for this, he came
                to [Location] to meet a friend while he was searching for him police arrested him under Section 109 of
                Cr.P.C. He was incarcerated under a bailable section that requires the bond and not custody. He was
                there in that prison for near about six months in a single piece of clothing. He also shared his
                mother’s and sister’s contact numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                His family was contacted and they turned up soon and narrated the agony they had gone through. How they
                were fooled by people in the name of help, and the trust issues they had while we contacted them. The
                family had suffered a lot because of the loopholes the justice system has.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Legal Recourse:</span> Panel Advocates of [Organization Name] Foundation tracked the case very well and carried
                out all the
                necessity that was ignored by others. They then filed a bail petition for the beneficiary, called the
                family to be the bailor, spent one whole day making the case a priority, and succeeded in getting bail
                for him on [Bail Date].
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Gap Analysis and Conclusion:</span> This case shows the pathetic structure of our justice system,
                and how
                innocent lives are merely ruined based on assumptions. Assumptions can’t be a basis for arresting a
                person because police do not have the capacity to read a person’s mind. When the police take someone in
                their custody the first step, they need to take is to inform the family or close ones of that person
                which was totally neglected. Where the friend or relative of the person arrested lives outside the
                district, the time and place of arrest and venue of custody must be notified by police within 8 to 12
                hours after arrest. This should be done by telegram through the District Legal Aid Authority and the
                concerned police station. When his family reached searching him no information was surpassed to them
                properly all they received were in bits and pieces. No heed was paid towards his fundamental right of
                liberty and was kept imprisoned until and unless we intervened.

            <h4>Violence leads to injustice</h4>

            <p>
                The prison visit to [Prison Name] exposed us to the injustice present in our judicial system.
                [Victim Name], a lady who is standing on the doors of her old age is locked behind the bars in her 50s.
                She was booked under Section 498A, 324, 326, 307, 304 (B) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. These offenses
                are serious in nature and prescribe a punishment of up to 10 years or life imprisonment.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was alleged that [Victim Name] along with her elder sister in the month of November 2009 sprinkled
                Kerosene
                on her sister-in-law and put her on fire. Thereafter in January 2010, she got arrested for this
                offense, while her sister fled away. [Victim Name] was imprisoned since then.
            </p>
            <p>
                In [Year], during the regular prison visit, the case of [Victim Name] Ji came to our notice. After this Adv.
                Santosh, the Senior Counsel of the organization, went to [Court Name] and pursued the records and found
                that in all these years nobody from her family hired an advocate to secure bail for her, neither she was
                given any advocate from DLSA. In [Year], in this case, a Non-Bailable Warrant was issued against the
                informant and other witnesses of the case but none turned up. Thrice NBW was issued against the
                informant and witnesses but neither of them appeared to the court on any prescribed date. Then Adv.
                Santosh Kumar along with Adv. Shalini scrutinized the case details and interacted with [Victim Name]
                through jail officials and procured her signature on Vakalatnama. Then, an application was filed to
                close evidence in this case. The court ordered police officials at [Location] to file a service report at
                earliest in this case. As per the report prepared by the police investigating the case, neither the
                informant nor the witnesses ever resided at that place according to the locals thereby.
            </p>
            <p>
                [Victim Name] was like a soul waiting for the day to be freed. She had lost her mental capacity for
                understanding. But the judicial system never functions on the emotion of prisoners rather it sticks to
                the judicial policy. Yet, the team comprising Adv. Santosh Kumar, Adv. Shivshankar, and Adv. Shalini
                never lost hope of a new beginning in [Victim Name] Ji’s life.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the day of International Women’s Day, the court acquitted [Victim Name] Ji from all charges in the
                present case on the ground of lack of evidence. She was then released on [Date]. Her brother
                came to receive her, and it was an emotional re-bonding of the siblings. Though she lost a major part of
                her life in the twelve years of imprisonment, she did not forget her family her husband, her father, and
                especially her siblings. She has paid a heavy amount in all these years. Her mental health has been
                adversely affected because of this. She does not remember her children. She is not aware that she has
                lost her husband in all these years nor she has the understanding to accept this fact. Justice came to
                her no doubt, but at a heavy cost of 12 years of her life. Maybe she will return to society but will she
                be accepted into society, will her kids accept her, or will she ever get to normalcy with her mental
                condition?

            <h4>Delayed but Justice delivered</h4>

            <p>
                The case began at Hanuman Mandir situated at [Location 1] Junction in [Location 2]. Md. Rehan, a 19-year-old boy,
                was arrested by Kotwali Police in [Month Year] for the offense of committing theft of a mobile phone. He was sent
                to judicial custody thereafter. In [Month Year + 4 months], when the team of [Org 1 Name] Foundation visited [Location
                3] Jail, they met him. After returning back to [Location 1], they pursued his case records and found that no bail
                has been filed in the last 4 months on his behalf. A bail application was filed by the advocates of [Org 1 Name]
                Foundation, which was heard by the magistrate and allowed, but there was no bailor on his behalf. After regular
                meetings and counseling Adv. Shalini gained his trust and he shared the proper address of his family and also his
                father’s mobile number. Without wasting any time, she then contacted his father, but his parents hardly cared about
                his existence. His father said, "I do not have money; I cannot spend my everything on him since I have to take care
                of my wife and other children too." After constant effort, we came to know that his mother died years ago, and his
                father and his stepmother and children disliked him because of this he left home and started working in a restaurant
                near [Location 1] Junction and landed up behind bars.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <span>Court Procedures:</span> Although the team secured bail, they failed to get him out of the jail, thus they
                moved ahead with the trial of the case. In the court, they facilitated in the framing of the charge after which the
                witnesses were summoned. But the witness did not turn up after two summonses. The SHO was ordered to serve a service
                report but failed to do so. Thereafter, the court issued a bailable warrant, and later in [Month Year], an NBW was
                issued against the witness to appear on the next date.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On [Date] all four witnesses were asked to appear again After which they appeared. None of them identified the
                accused and had various discrepancies in their statements. There was no eyewitness to the case, the case was not
                investigated by the I.O. properly. Then, on [Date], the magistrate pronounced the judgment in favor of the accused
                and acquitted him of all the charges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The trial, in this case, was completed in just a span of five months. Although the accused had to remain in jail for
                nine months, yet the best thing is that now he is a free bird and has a chance to start with new beginnings. The
                experience he had with the criminal justice system would make him realize the bitter truths of life.
